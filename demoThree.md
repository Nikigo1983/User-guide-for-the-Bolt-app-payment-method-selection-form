# User guide for the Bolt  app payment method selection form
For your convenience, Bolt Taxi provides several ride service programs to choose from: personal and work. These options will be useful if it is important for you to separate rides taken for work purposes from personal ones. By default, the personal trips option will work.

After adding a work profile, you will be able to switch the payment methods for trips from work to personal and vice versa, if necessary. 
## Selecting a payment method
Before ordering, open the application menu to select the payment method. Click on the first menu option "Payment" (Fig. 1):

## Setting up the payment method
As we already know, there are two payment methods in the app for personal and business trips: via debit/credit card and via PayPal. Let's look at how each one works in detail. 

### Add debit/credit card
If you prefer to pay by card, click on "Add debit/credit card" in the "Add payment method" box (see fig.9 above). A form will appear in front of you to fill in your card details (fig. 10):

![Figure 10](./pic10.png)

Once you have completed the form, click on the "Add card" button. As the message on the screen says, Bolt may charge your card a small amount to confirm its details. Don't worry, your card will be refunded instantly.

Once you successfully complete the validation process, your card will be linked to your Bolt app profile. You will be able to use it to pay for your trips in the app.

If you have problems adding your card, please make sure that:
1. You have entered your card details correctly.
2. You have enough funds in your bank account.
3. Your card has not expired.
4. Online transactions are available for your card.
5. You add a MasterCard or Visa card. American Express cards are accepted in Eurozone countries only.
6. From 07.03.2022 it is not possible to use cards issued by Russian banks.
### Add PayPal
If you have decided to pay for your trips via PayPal, choose "Add PayPal" option in the "Add payment method" window (see Fig. 9 above). A form for filling in your PayPal account details will appear (fig. 11):

After successfully completing the data validation process, your PayPal account will be linked to your Bolt app profile. This will allow you to quickly pay for your trips in the app. 

## Payment method switches
Note that after adding a work profile (see fig. 5 "Working payment method" option) when selecting payment methods, the "Payment" screen will change and look slightly different. In the "Payment methods" option there will be two buttons "Personal" and "Work" that can be easily switched when you change your travel goals (fig. 13, fig. 14). 

If you choose a personal payment method, you press the "Personal" button (fig.13). The color of the selected button will change from white to green:

If you need to pay for a journey undertaken for work purposes, you press the adjacent "Work" button (fig. 14):
